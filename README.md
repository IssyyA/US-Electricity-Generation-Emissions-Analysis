# US Electricity Generation & Emissions Analysis (2001-2023)

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the United States' electricity landscape from 2001 to 2023. Using a dataset covering electricity generation by source, state, and year, this interactive Power BI dashboard visualizes key trends in total energy production, the adoption of renewable energy, and resulting CO2 emissions. The primary goal is to offer a clear, data-driven overview for policymakers, energy analysts, and the public to understand state-level performance and national progress towards a cleaner energy future.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

* Category 1: Overall Energy Generation & Trends
* Category 2: Renewable Energy Performance & Adoption
* Category 3: CO2 Emissions & Environmental Impact
* Category 4: State-Level Performance & Disparities

The dataset was modeled and analyzed using Power Query and DAX in Power BI to create a user-friendly and insightful dashboard.

**Tables**
*   **Fact_Energy_source:** The core fact table containing the quantitative data (`Value`) for electricity generation. It links to all dimensions and includes attributes like `Category`, `Energy Source`, `State`, `Subcategory`, `Unit`, and `Year`.
*   **Dim_State:** A dimension table for geographic filtering, containing `State` names and `State code`.
*   **Dim_Year:** A dimension table for time-series analysis, containing the `Year`.
*   **Dim_EnergyCategory:** A dimension that classifies energy sources by `Category` (e.g., Renewable, Non-Renewable), `Energy Source` (e.g., Solar, Coal), and `Subcategory`.
*   **Dim_Units:** A dimension table defining the `Unit` of measurement for the values in the fact table (e.g., GWh).

**DAX Measures**
*   **DAX Measures Table:** A dedicated table holding key calculated measures, including `CO2 Emissions`, ensuring centralized and consistent calculations throughout the report.

### Executive Summary

**Overview of Findings**
Between 2001 and 2023, the United States saw a steady increase in total electricity generation. However, the transition to renewable energy remains a work in progress, with non-renewable sources still dominating the energy mix and contributing to significant CO2 emissions, particularly in high-production states.

*   Total electricity generation over this period reached **240 million GWh**.
*   Renewable energy accounted for **38.01 million GWh**, representing a modest **16%** of the total energy share.
*   CO2 emissions totaled **101.63 million kilotons (KTC02)**.
*   **Texas** leads the nation in both total electricity generation and CO2 emissions, while **Washington** is the top state for renewable energy generation.
*   There is a clear upward trend in electricity generation year-over-year, highlighting a growing demand that must be met with cleaner sources.

### Insights Deep Dive

**Category 1: Overall Energy Generation & Trends**
*   The total electricity generated from 2001 to 2023 was **240M GWh**. The "Electricity Generated by Year" chart shows a consistent and significant upward trend, indicating rising national energy demand.
*   **Texas** is the largest producer of electricity by a wide margin, followed by **California** and **Florida**. These top three states are critical to the nation's energy supply but also face the biggest challenges in transitioning their large-scale infrastructure.
*   The energy mix is heavily skewed towards non-renewable sources, which make up **84.17%** (202.7M GWh) of the total generation, as shown in the donut chart.

**Category 2: Renewable Energy Performance & Adoption**
*   Renewable energy sources contributed **38.01M GWh**, or just **15.83%** of the total energy mix. While this share is growing, it highlights the scale of the transition still required.
*   The leaders in renewable energy generation are different from the overall leaders. **Washington** state is the top producer of renewable energy, likely due to its significant hydropower capacity.
*   **California** and **Texas** also rank in the top 3 for renewables, demonstrating that large energy-producing states are making significant investments in green energy, even if it remains a smaller portion of their total portfolio. This is a crucial finding, as their success is key to moving the national needle.

**Category 3: CO2 Emissions & Environmental Impact**
*   A total of **101.63M KTC02** were emitted over the period. The choropleth map provides a stark visualization of where these emissions are concentrated.
*   Unsurprisingly, the states with the highest electricity generation are also the largest emitters. **Texas** has the highest CO2 emissions, aligning with its status as the top energy producer. States in the industrial Midwest and the Southeast also show high emission levels.
*   This direct correlation between high generation and high emissions underscores the urgent need to increase the renewable energy share to decouple energy growth from environmental impact.

**Category 4: State-Level Performance & Disparities**
*   The data reveals distinct energy profiles at the state level. States like **Washington** and **Oregon** have a strong renewable footprint, while states like **Texas**, **Florida**, and **Pennsylvania** rely heavily on traditional, non-renewable sources.
*   There is a significant opportunity for knowledge sharing and policy modeling from leading renewable states to those lagging behind.
*   California presents an interesting case, appearing in the top lists for both overall generation and renewable generation, highlighting its dual role as a major energy consumer and a leader in the green transition.

### Recommendations

*   **Target High-Emission States:** Federal and state policies should focus on providing incentives and regulatory support for states like Texas and Florida to accelerate their transition away from fossil fuels. This could include tax credits for renewable projects and stricter emissions standards.
*   **Replicate Success from Renewable Leaders:** Analyze the policies, geographic advantages (e.g., hydro, solar potential), and investment models of states like Washington and Oregon. Develop frameworks to help other states adopt similar successful strategies.
*   **Accelerate Investment to Decouple Growth:** The upward trend in energy demand will lead to higher emissions unless the renewable energy share grows faster. National strategy should prioritize massive investment in solar, wind, and grid modernization to meet future demand cleanly.
*   **Promote State-Specific Energy Roadmaps:** A one-size-fits-all approach is ineffective. Encourage each state to develop a tailored energy roadmap based on its unique resources, demand profile, and current infrastructure, with clear targets for increasing renewable share and reducing emissions.

### Assumptions

*   The dataset provided is accurate and complete for the period of 2001-2023.
*   The classification of energy sources into "Renewable" and "Non-Renewable" categories is consistent and accurate.
*   The `CO2 Emissions` DAX measure uses a standard and accepted methodology for its calculation based on the generation data.
